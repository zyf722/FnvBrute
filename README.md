# FnvBrute (for Frostbite)
> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the original [FnvBrute](https://github.com/xyx0826/FnvBrute) repository.

## Introduction

FnvBrute is a simple tool for finding collisions in 32-bit FNV-1 hashes. 
These hashes are primarily used by Wwise, a widely used video game audio middleware.

~~Since FnvBrute is designed with Wwise hashes in mind, **it is important to note that plain texts are generated under these rules:**~~

FnvBrute in this repository is modified to work with ***Frostbite*** hashes, and **the rules for generating plain texts are changed to match Frostbite's hash generation rules**:

- The first byte can only be a letter (both uppercase and lowercase)
- Any byte after that can be a letter or a digit

The implementation of FnvBrute is very barebone. It offers no GPU acceleration, dictionary support, or pause/resume/checkpoint features. 
FnvBrute uses very basic multithreading; it spins up a separate thread for every length of plain text. 
Workload on a single plain text length is not distributed across multiple threads.

## Usage

`FnvBrute.exe {hash} {maxLength}`

`hash`: The target hash to look for. Accepts a decimal or hexadecimal `uint32_t` value.

`maxLength`: The maximum length of the plain text. Must be greater or equal to 2.

## Example

```
>FnvBrute.exe 0x50c63a23 8
Hash: 1355168291, max plaintext length: 8
Creating hasher for length 2
Creating hasher for length 3
Creating hasher for length 4
Creating hasher for length 5
Creating hasher for length 6
Creating hasher for length 7
Creating hasher for length 8
Hasher for length 2 finished in 0s
Hasher for length 3 finished in 0s
Length 4 match: >> init << in 0s
Hasher for length 4 finished in 0s
Hasher for length 5 finished in 0s
Hasher for length 6 finished in 19s
Length 8 match: >> a1std32t << in 48s
Length 8 match: >> a2erup9z << in 65s
Length 8 match: >> a4d3b7yd << in 120s
Length 7 match: >> eu7cnee << in 133s
Length 8 match: >> a5tcfrd7 << in 160s
Length 8 match: >> a5_1eyxj << in 165s
Length 8 match: >> a7b70fg4 << in 202s
Length 7 match: >> hez2vro << in 204s

```

## Development

FnvBrute is written with .NET Core 3, though it is compatible with earlier .NET Core or Framework versions. Pull requests are very welcome.
